The comprehensive serverless migration blueprint has been successfully created and saved to storage/blueprint.json. The blueprint includes:

1. **Backend Architecture**: Lambda functions grouped by auth and todo domains, with shared Lambda layers for common utilities. Step Functions are not required for this simple CRUD application.

2. **Frontend Architecture**: Identified files requiring migration (config.js and App.js due to hardcoded URLs), files to copy unchanged (UI components and styles), and new configuration files needed (.env.example and aws-exports.js).

3. **Data Architecture**: DynamoDB table schemas directly from the analysis report, including todo-monolith-users and todo-monolith-table with their respective attributes, indexes, and table relationships.

4. **Authentication Strategy**: Amazon Cognito User Pools configuration with frontend integration using AWS Amplify and backend integration via API Gateway Cognito Authorizer.

5. **API Gateway Configuration**: REST API design with proper resource paths, CORS settings for frontend access, and deployment stages (dev, prod).

The blueprint provides a complete migration roadmap without implementation details, following a lift-and-shift with serverless refactoring strategy.
